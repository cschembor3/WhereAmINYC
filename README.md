# Where Am I NYC

A simple watchOS app to display which neighborhood/borough of New York City you are currently in.

## Motivation

Have you ever been walking around in New York City and wondered, "where exactly am I right now"? This happens all the time to me. As someone who doesn't
leave his area of Brooklyn all that often, I never know which neighborhood of Manhattan I'm in on the rare occasion I do venture out into the city.

To remedy this little annoyance, I've created `WhereAmINYC`, which lets you know whatever neighborhood and borough you are currently in.
